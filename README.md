# Jigsaw

A sample repository to experiment with Java's modularization (aka. Jigsaw).

### Note
The scripts are written to work with the [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/) for Windows. You may need to update these scripts with the correct path to your JDK and your OS' specific way to specify paths for files (like "/" and "\\").
